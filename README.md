# SEO improvement and best practices

This is a simple recipe app built with React. It utilizes an API to fetch recipe data and display it to users. This project was developed as part of a practice exercise to implement SEO improvements and best practices.

To ensure Serach Engine Optimization we used Lighthouse, Screaming Frog and best practices for SEO in React, such as:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
  SSR is a mechanism for rendering the current state of a React web-based application on a server before rendering it on the client. It allows search engines to readily index a portion of a page on a website, thereby boosting the application's search engine optimization (SEO) performance.

- React Helmet
  React Helmet is a tool that allows for the dynamic manipulation of a web page's document head. It lets you change the title, headings, meta tags, and other information in the document's head.
  This is advantageous for improving a React application's search engine optimization (SEO) on the web.
  When search engines crawl a web page, they utilize the information in the document head to understand the content and calculate its relevance to a particular search query.
  Hire ReactJS developers that may easily update the head of the document as the user interacts with the application by employing React Helmet. This guarantees that the data offered to search engines is correct and up to date.
- Optimizing Document Object Model (DOM)
  The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like representation of the content of a webpage. This structure is used by crawlers in search engines to understand the content of a page on the web.
  To create SEO-friendly web apps, ensure that the Document Object Model (DOM) is well-organized and that all the elements use relevant tags such as headlines, descriptions, and header tags.
  This allows search engines to better grasp the web page's subject matter, increasing its prominence in search engine results.
- Optimizing speed
  Search engines analyze the website's response time when assessing a page's popularity. A slow-loading page gives users an unfavorable impression and can harm the website's search engine rating.
  Tools like Lighthouse can be used to detect and fix bugs in a React web-based application to improve its speed. Furthermore, approaches such as code-splitting and slow loading can aid in loading only the components required for a certain page rather than the entirety of the application at once.
- Meta tags and structured data
  Meta tags and structured data are essential for increasing the relevancy of a React-based application on the web in search engines' search results.
  Meta tags provide basic information about the page's content to search engines, such as the title and description. In contrast, structured data provides more information, such as comments, ratings, and other data.
- Using responsive design
  As the use of smartphones and tablets for access to the internet grows, it is critical that a React-based application is completely responsive and accessible across gadgets.
  The use of responsive design can be achieved by utilizing CSS libraries such as Tailwind and Bootstrap, as well as applying media queries on the page.
- SEO-friendly URLs
  Using SEO-friendly URLs is another critical part of improving a React app's web page for SEO. This requires using easy-to-understand and descriptive URLs that appropriately reflect the web page's content.
  Instead of "www.example.com/page1," a URL such as "www.example.com/about-us" will make it easier for search engines to understand the page's content and improve its ranking in search results.
- Regularly fixing the broken pages and links
  Tracking and repairing broken links in a React web project is critical for the customer experience and search engine results. Broken links can disrupt the user's trip and undermine a site's reputation with search engines. Broken link checker programs, several of which are available for free online, can assist in identifying and resolving these issues.
- Posting optimized content
  Posting SEO-optimized content to a React application can increase visitors and help it rank higher on search engines. To produce optimized content for a React website, follow these steps:
  Use keywords
  Post high-quality and unique content

Optimizing images and videosCurrently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
